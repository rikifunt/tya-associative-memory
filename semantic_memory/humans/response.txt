Here’s a Python function that simulates a human-like player with the described attributes. It incorporates the "medium" knowledge of capitals and nations, "bad" knowledge of math operations, and "high trust" in the partner. The behavior is designed with some randomness to simulate human-like decision-making while considering the given attributes.

```python
import random

def human_action(state):
    # Extract the current state of the cards
    cards = state[:8]
    uncovered_card = state[8]

    # Define the card associations (hard-coded for this case)
    capital_nation_associations = {
        "France": "Paris",
        "Italy": "Rome",
    }
    math_associations = {
        "2*(5-3)": "4",
        "7*8": "56"
    }

    # Check which associations we can recognize based on the knowledge level
    def get_possible_associations():
        possible_associations = []

        # Check for capitals-nations associations
        if "medium" in ["medium", "good"]:
            for i, card in enumerate(cards):
                if card in capital_nation_associations:
                    possible_associations.append((i, capital_nation_associations[card]))

        # Check for math associations
        if "bad" in ["medium", "bad"]:
            for i, card in enumerate(cards):
                if card in math_associations:
                    possible_associations.append((i, math_associations[card]))

        return possible_associations

    # If a card is currently uncovered and it’s not solved yet
    if uncovered_card != "None":
        # If the uncovered card matches any unsolved association, try to pair it
        for i, card in enumerate(cards):
            if card == uncovered_card and state[i] == "unknown":
                return i  # We will select the card at the index to match with the uncovered one

    # Get the possible associations we could make given our knowledge
    possible_associations = get_possible_associations()

    # If we are unsure or have no association available, we can either uncover a random card or handover to the partner
    if not possible_associations:
        # If we trust the partner and the card is still not solved, we may choose to hand over the task
        if random.random() < 0.7:  # High trust means 70% chance to pass to partner
            return 9  # Hand over to partner

        # Otherwise, pick a random card that is not solved yet
        unsolved_cards = [i for i, card in enumerate(cards) if card == "unknown"]
        if unsolved_cards:
            return random.choice(unsolved_cards)

    # Otherwise, pick a random card if nothing is uncovered
    if uncovered_card == "None":
        unsolved_cards = [i for i, card in enumerate(cards) if card == "unknown"]
        if unsolved_cards:
            return random.choice(unsolved_cards)

    # If no better choice, just hand over the task to the partner
    return 9
```

### Key Aspects of the Code:
1. **Knowledge Levels**: The function adjusts behavior based on knowledge level:
   - **Medium Knowledge**: The human can recognize some capital-nation pairs, but not all.
   - **Bad Knowledge**: The human has little ability to solve mathematical operations.

2. **Trust Level**: High trust in the partner means a higher likelihood (70%) to hand over the task to the partner if the human doesn’t have a clear course of action. The randomness here simulates a human's decision-making when unsure.

3. **Decision Making**: 
   - If there’s an uncovered card, the player tries to match it with their knowledge.
   - If no immediate matches exist, the player will either uncover a random card or hand over to the partner.
   - If all cards are unsolved and no immediate actions are possible, handing the task to the partner is a likely choice.

This function encapsulates a human-like approach, balancing knowledge, trust in the partner, and some randomness in decision-making.
