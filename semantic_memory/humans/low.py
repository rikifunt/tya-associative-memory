ChatGPT comment:

Here's a function that simulates a human-like player based on the given constraints. The player has "bad" knowledge about both categories and "high trust" in the partner. The function incorporates stochastic elements to reflect human-like decision-making.

This function balances stochastic behavior and logical consistency while considering the player's "bad" knowledge and "high trust" in the partner. Let me know if you need refinements!
