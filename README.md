## TODO

- [x] have a different array for cards that are just face up temporarily, and
  cards that are face up because they are solved (rendered with different
  colors), and also turn card B face up temporarily so agents can see it in
  next observation (in which no action is meaningful, and it just determines
  whether there is a match or no and then switches turns)
